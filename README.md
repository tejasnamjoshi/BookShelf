# My Book Shelf

### This is a practice project. I had not used vanilla JS in a couple of years and wanted to create a simple application just to refresh my vanilla JS knowledge.

## About the app
 - This app serves as a virtual bookshelf.
 - Books can be added and removed easily.
 - The data is persistent and is saved inside local storage.

## Technical
 - This app is prepare using HTML, Bootstrap and vanilla JS without any JS frameworks.
 - It uses the default bootstrap 5 theme.

 ## How to run
  - Open the index.html file in a browser. No need of a server to run this.

## Thanks
 - I would like to thank Brad Traversy because this was inspired from his YouTube video.
